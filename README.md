media-links
====================

An inline link script for multimedia storytelling. Customized to work inside the LA Times hella hacky CMS. But will probably work for you, with some customization. 

For ease of including in the CMS, everything is included in one file. 

inline links for:
	- videos 
		- brightcove
		- youtube
		- vimeo
		- NDN
	- static images
	- document snippets from Document Cloud

	-- what else?
